The hallway never felt this empty. The rain clattered against the windows relentlessly, the sound echoing throughout the empty halls. Nobody in their right mind would wander these halls. No thief would dare to move through this weather, no guard would risk getting the floor wet, and no resident would be up at this hour. A flash of light brightens the hallway, revealing the paintings of old, the map of land with its 3 countries and the forest, and the giant family crest representing the kingdom with a lone figure standing in front of it. "1, 2, 3" A loud thunder reverberates through the chandeliers, making them swing back and forth. back, and forth. 
Until... Silence. 
It wasn't long before another flash lit up the hallway. The figure had begun to move towards the east side of the building. "1, 2" Louder, and heavier. The thunder crashed without remorse.
