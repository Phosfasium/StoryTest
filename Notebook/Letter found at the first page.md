My dear friend,

I was glad to hear that your recovery is going well. I am so sorry that i have not been able to give you a place to rest during your recovery. I am truly thankful of everyone who helped you to get back on your feet. You are probably still restless and lost, without a goal. 
For this reason I have given you this gift. The paper in this notebook is made of my own branches, it will be able to stay with you for a long time across worlds. So I have a request for you. Instead of endless wandering, Please write down facts about the worlds that you find yourself in. Find points of interest, find things that are similar between worlds, find whatever you want to find and write it down. Who knows, maybe it can help you in the future, or maybe even someone else. I hope that this will give you a goal, no matter how small it is.

It is not known when we will meet again. But until then. Stay safe my friend. 

Best regards,
Your friend and mentor
Deku Hollis
